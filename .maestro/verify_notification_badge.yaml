# This flow verifies that when an app has notifications,
# the badge dot/count appears next to its favorite entry.
#
# PREREQUISITE: The user must have:
#   1. At least one app added to favorites
#   2. Notification Access granted to Longboi in system settings
#   3. A pending notification from that app
#
# Run manually:
#   maestro test .maestro/verify_notification_badge.yaml

- launchApp
- assertVisible: "Swipe up for all apps"

# Take a screenshot to visually inspect notification badges
- takeScreenshot: notification_badges

# The test operator reviews the screenshot for badge presence.
# For full automation, use Maestro MCP with an LLM to analyze the screenshot:
#   "Does the screenshot show any notification badge dots next to app names?"

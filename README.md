Use the `Makefile` for convenient shortcuts:
```bash
make test          # Run all tests
make test-unit     # Unit tests only
make coverage      # Generate coverage report
make format        # Format code with Spotless
make lint          # Run Android lint
make assemble      # Build debug APK
```

## Permissions

Longboi needs a few permissions to work as a launcher. None of them are used to collect or send your data anywhere.

- **`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`** — Lets the app see what's installed on your phone so it can show your app list. Without this, the launcher would have nothing to display.
- **`BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE`** — Used to show notification badges/counts on apps. You can deny this and the launcher will work fine, just without badges.
- **`BIND_APPWIDGET`** — Needed to host home screen widgets. Standard for any launcher.
